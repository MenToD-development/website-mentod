## About Menno

I am a full-stack web developer who started out on my own under the name MenToD. Through this company you can hire me to co-develop projects and/or have me develop something for you.

After working for over 10 years at Fourdesign I made the choice to start my own business. At Fourdesign I built many websites, did hosting support and gained a lot of experience in project management. The last 4 years I have been a Lead Developer.

In these years I have gained a lot of experience in all possible areas related to web development and I would like to expand this further. I was therefore also looking for challenges in the field of programming.

## My goal

I have many ideas for projects in my head. These are projects to develop framework tools, open source packages and/or complete products. All related with web-development. These projects are what I want to develop. The problem with these projects is that they are all internal and therefore personal developments and therefore I don't make money with them.

Therefore I want to hire me as a Freelance Full-Stack Developer and work with this so I can earn money which I can then invest in a project from my ideas.

## About MenToD

MenToD is the company under which I can perform my work as a Freelance Full-Stack web developer.
